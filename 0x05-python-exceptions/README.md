# Python Exceptions
#### I practice how to handle errors gracefully using, understanding use cases of some  Python keywords such as: 
- Try
- Except
- Raise
- Pass, Continue, Break
- Else
- Finally
#### I also get to familiarize with various types of exceptions such as IndexError, ZeroDivisionError, etc.
