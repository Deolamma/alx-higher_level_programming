#### TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT IN PYTHON
### In this project I explore the concept of doctest and unittest test cases in Python. Some of the key learnings are:
- Understanding the importance of TDD as Software Engineers
- Understanding the concept of Unit testing and Doc testing
- Understand the difference between interactive and non-interactive tests
- Writing Docstrings to create tests
- Finding edge cases
